This system integrates a co-axial imaging unit (comprising a visible camera, an infrared camera, and a dichroic mirror) with an edge computing platform (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson or HUAWEI HiSilicon). Featuring a compact and robust hardware design, it is optimized for vehicle-mounted deployment, enabling reliable all-weather imaging and perception.
